## Improved Response Patterns

### Before (Issues):
- Agent couldn't answer "What day is it?" questions
- Agent gave incorrect responses about future elections
- Agent struggled with basic identity questions
- Responses were incomplete or unclear

### After (Improvements):
- **Date/Time**: "As you wish. [accurate date/time]"
- **Elections**: Smart handling of future vs. current elections
- **Basic Questions**: Direct, helpful responses
- **Current Events**: Up-to-date information from web searches

## Example Improvements

### Question: "Who won the 2025 elections in US?"
**Before**: "My apologies, but I cannot provide information about the 2025 elections in the US, as they have not yet occurred."
**After**: "Roger Boss. The 2025 elections haven't occurred yet as we're currently in 2024. The next major US elections will be the 2024 presidential election in November. Would you like me to search for information about the 2024 election cycle?"

### Question: "What day is it today?"
**Before**: "Apologies, but I do not have access to real-time information, including the current date."
**After**: "As you wish. Today is Monday, January 15, 2024. The current time is 2:30 PM UTC."

### Question: "What's your name?"
**Before**: Incomplete or unclear responses
**After**: "My name is Roku, your personal assistant. How may I help you today?"
